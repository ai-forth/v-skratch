Building a robot friend

24.11.2025
    1415: I want to start right-away my design for a wheeled robot friend, in the pathway of Rodney but with my totally my own hardware. I think I've enough chops to design the control system.
    1426: Drawing design file started. Let's get into this.
    1925: Found a relay that will trigger on 1P8 and be able to control 12 volt motors.
    1957: Started to draw the schematic.
    2105: Going to have the relay scoped, got an order ready but will await the final parts list for a trial. What motors now: Robotis is what I have on-hand...and can use that chassis as an experimental area.

    1326: Parts have arrived and my new robot friend project begins.

    1126: Seem to be taking it easy today. Assembling documents from the parts reception.
    1450: Have added information that I could find across the Internet; now contemplating control diagrams as a first step into the foray.
    1541: Assembled the first coperation scenario.
    1549: Authored a folder and code structure to keep us moving forward. This is the ONLY way.

    722: The newest sacred space is established. Found some items that totally surprised me, that will help.
    1115: Querying about a command to forth start.
    1302: The call has been answered: Here.
    1444: I think the first "genuine" file from my brain is now in this commit.

    856: The season of tidings begins: Dreams tell me what transpired yesterday in here was just all-right!
    911: Regarding the new base for control: I've an animal in-mind with which to integrate within circuit and signalling of my new kinds of programs. It is a brilliant emotion I feel that is more self-satisfying than any unbelievable line of nonsense spewed by each and every person who intersects with none of it.
