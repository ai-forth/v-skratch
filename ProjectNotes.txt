Building a robot friend

24.11.2025
    1415: I want to start right-away my design for a wheeled robot friend, in the pathway of Rodney but with my totally my own hardware. I think I've enough chops to design the control system.
    1426: Drawing design file started. Let's get into this.
    1925: Found a relay that will trigger on 1P8 and be able to control 12 volt motors.
    1957: Started to draw the schematic.
    2105: Going to have the relay scoped, got an order ready but will await the final parts list for a trial. What motors now: Robotis is what I have on-hand...and can use that chassis as an experimental area.
25.11.2025
    1326: Parts have arrived and my new robot friend project begins.
26.11.2025
    1126: Seem to be taking it easy today. Assembling documents from the parts reception.
    1450: Have added information that I could find across the Internet; now contemplating control diagrams as a first step into the foray.
    1541: Assembled the first coperation scenario.
    1549: Authored a folder and code structure to keep us moving forward. This is the ONLY way.

    910: Toys in the office and thinking to have a play.
29.11.2025
    722: The newest sacred space is established. Found some items that totally surprised me, that will help.
    1115: Querying about a command to forth start.
    1302: The call has been answered: Here.
    1444: I think the first "genuine" file from my brain is now in this commit.
    2302: Just to indicate I am still here.
30.11.2025
    856: The season of tidings begins: Dreams tell me what transpired yesterday in here was just all-right!
    911: Regarding the new base for control: I've an animal in-mind with which to integrate within circuit and signalling of my new kinds of programs. It is a brilliant emotion I feel that is more self-satisfying than any unbelievable line of nonsense spewed by each and every person who intersects with none of it.
    1330: Things are in-order.
01.12.2025
    1026: Petster distractions all-around.
    1045: Given this: Created a logical organization of the feature-set.
    1100: A better organizational principle has been applied.
    1108: Looking at everything: Seems area 'C' is where I should begin implementation.
    1648: Worked stopped and went for a sandwich, never got back to it until now.
    1729: Pseudocodes and switch-case in the vault.
    1814: Yep: I think that's it!
    1823: Not really. More pseudocode.
    1940: Done for the day.
11.12.2025
    1212: Cleanly set volatco, volatco-shop, and this as a sequence of increasing coolness.
    1228: Test check-in from IDE environment.
12.12.2025
    1251: Chassis is assembled. Took about an hour. Will need to build-up via i-beam slider, like some previous project, I'm sure...
13.12.2025
    1055: Went to aiventure-computer and pulled the specs. Published them on the main readme. Summary: 25 GPIO, 10 Ain, 10 Aout.
    1105: Updated further and summarized in brief the specifications of Volatco Model-A.
    1735: Established all parts required for the chassis platforms and the lean into the paper for phototaxis, sound reaction, and cooperation.
    1905: Remembering the work for david-joi; this should be used with Volatco. Added dynamixel data.
16.12.2025
    1932: Designed the basic draft of the motor control circuitry.
18.12.2025
    1339: Have the robot chassis alternative parts all ready for exploration. Here I go! :-)
    1406: Settled on a first-draft motor control circuit.
    1806: Started assembling one robot chassis; with the encoder addition, need to print motor mounts with a longer neck.
    1904: Length is a bit far so introducing a spacer.
    1906: Stopping the machines for the night. Will focus on getting the parts printed this evening.
21.12.2025
    1223: Gathering the motor data so I can start to design the control system, after building the second unit.
23.12.2025
    1229: Gathered the peripherals data for the robots.
24.12.2025
    1310: Peripherals sorted, how to mount appropriately (twice) is the challenge.
    1631: Making and printing models for the set of sensor backplanes.
